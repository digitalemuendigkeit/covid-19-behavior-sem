This website contains supplementary material for our paper "Perceptions of behaviour efficacy, not perceptions of threat, are drivers of COVID-19 protective behaviour in Germany". Specifically, we detail the process of model evaluation and provide the full results of the additional exploratory data analysis. We also present the survey design.

We plan to publish the paper in Humanities and Social Sciences Communications. Once it is published, a DOI will be added to this site.
